# [Shoestrap](https://github.com/aristath/shoestrap)

Shoestrap is a child theme of the amazing [Roots theme](http://rootstheme.com ).

### Caution to themers:
Before changing your theme's css, we suggest that you first use the customizer to apply any colors etc.
If you find that you need something more, then DO NOT edit the assets/css/app.css file.
This theme includes a PHP-Less compiler, so you can use lesscss styles in your theme and take full advantage of its nesting, mixins etc.
You can even directly use bootstrap's mixins when writing your less styles.
To learn more about Less-CSS, please take a look at http://lesscss.org/
Of course if you don't want to use less, you can simply write your own CSS, but again NOT in the assets/css/app.css file.
Instead, use the assets/css/app.less file.
When a change in that file is detected, the less compiler minifies it and the output is written in the assets/css/app.css file.
If you apply your changes and you don't see them applied in your theme, 
please make sure that it is writable and your server has write permissions for the assets/css/app.css file.
